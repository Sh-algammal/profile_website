            Hello! I'm a passionate web developer and designer with a keen eye for creating beautiful, functional, and
            user-friendly websites. With several years of experience in the industry, I've had the opportunity to work
            on a wide range of projects, from small business websites to large-scale web applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            My expertise lies in front-end development, where I excel at turning designs into responsive, interactive
            web experiences. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Next.js. I
            also have experience with back-end technologies and enjoy working on full-stack projects.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, or
            enjoying the great outdoors. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects
            that push my skills to the next level.
